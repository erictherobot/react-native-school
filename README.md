# React Native School

Hey, I'm Eric and I'd like to help you learn how to build Native  IOS & Android Apps using React Native.

Whether you're just starting out programming or whether you've been working as an engineer for years. One thing is for certain, we can always learn from other people.

### How it works

- Simply follow the lesson plan i.e. "LESSON_01_HELLO_WORLD" is the first lesson.
- Read the "README.md" in each lesson plan.
- Read the code comments in each file.

### Use at your own risk

Please be advised that I am not an expert in anything. These examples are "how I do things" and may not always be the best practices. If you get stuck on anything, please reach out to me on [twitter.com/erictherobot](https://twitter.com/erictherobot) or create a new issue and or pull request.
